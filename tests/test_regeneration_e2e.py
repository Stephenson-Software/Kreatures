"""
End-to-end test to verify health regeneration behavior in a realistic game scenario.

This test simulates a realistic game scenario where:
1. An entity gets damaged in combat
2. The entity continues taking actions while health is low
3. Health regenerates passively over time
4. The entity never becomes idle due to regeneration
